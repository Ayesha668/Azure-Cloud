# Azure-Cloud
Set Up Azure OpenAI Service:

Sign in to the Azure portal and create an Azure OpenAI resource.
Configure necessary permissions and access controls.
Prepare Your Data:

Clean and format your data appropriately. Common formats include JSON or CSV.
Ensure your data is structured in a way that aligns with the model’s requirements.
Fine-Tuning (if applicable):

Depending on your needs, you might want to fine-tune a model using your dataset.
Use the Azure OpenAI fine-tuning APIs to upload your data and initiate the fine-tuning process.
Creating API Calls:

Use the Azure OpenAI API to interact with the model. You’ll need to construct requests with your data.
Make sure to handle authentication and set the appropriate headers.
Testing and Iteration:

After deploying, test the outputs and refine your queries or model parameters as necessary.
Iterate on your approach based on the results.
Monitoring and Optimization:

Monitor usage and performance. Azure provides tools for logging and analytics.
Optimize your setup based on user feedback and performance metrics.
